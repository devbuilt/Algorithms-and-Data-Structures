# What is a Algorithm?

### A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

### Almost everyting that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm.

### I'ts the foundation for being a succesfull problem solving and developer.

## How do you improve?
### 1. Devise a plan for solving problems.
### 2. Master common problem solving patterns

## PROBLEM SOLVING 
### * Understanding the Problem
### * Explore Concrete Examples
### * Break it Down
### * Solve/Simplify
### * Look Back and refactor

### Understand the problem
### 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
### 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
### 3. What are the outpust that should come from the solution to the problem?
### 4. Can the ouputs be determined from the inputs? In the other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?(You may not be able to answer the question until you set about solving the problem. Thas okay; its still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
